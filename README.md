VLC uses visible light between 400 THz (780 nm) and 800 THz (375 nm). VLC uses lights (ordinary lights/lamps) or LEDs to transmit data. Since light from these sources is not detrimental to the human eye/vision, and is immune to radio frequency interference and congestion, VLC technology is emerging as a new, innovative means of transmitting data.
